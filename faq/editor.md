# General Questions

**How fast can we insure?** The launch plan we have out for now is mostly around MVP which includes socials setup, a decent website, AI agent/token launchpad if we go that route, team credibility/dox, and a roadmap to launch that we stick to. The goal would be that either outside capital or a well-done launch allows us to insure up to a certain amount within the first roadmap cycle of 30 days. Could be pushed to 1-2 weeks with the right devs onboard. We just would artificially cap the amount we can cover.

**Terminal tokenomics?** We’re still working on the best model here. The token would certainly be staked for liquidity into the claim pool. Premiums would be paid via staking. One thought is allowing for a 6 month policy, staking that amount, and at the end, being able to unstake and reclaim those tokens minus 10%. Obviously 10% is a small fee, so it could be a different value. Alternatively, we could simply “charge a premium” and accept the payment in the token. The only reason I think stake/unstake may work, is to build initial confidence. Model could be DAO voted to change later. Tokens for fake claims/fraud/issues, would be burnt. Two/three tiers of staking for the DAO, with the highest tier being the claim board, which we can also curate quite easily.

Tokens could also be spent on a risk oracle, which we believe is a big part of the longer vision.

**Social engineering, volatiity, etc?** With the right planning, evidence, and research into claims, we can reduce this as much as possible. There’s no silver bullet but getting OSINT researchers on the DAO is one step. Lockups is another. As far as volatility, we could certainly incentivize a stable pool for claims as well. Or do a mix.

**Risk Model?** Constant WIP. Right now, the plan is for the website to present as (A \* C \* L \* R) / P.

That is (A)sset value, (C)overage percentage, (L)oss Probability, Target Claims (R)eserve), Insurance (P)eriod.

So for $100k - (100,00&#x30;_&#x30;.&#x38;_&#x30;.05\*1.1)/6. This presumes 80% return on assets(which we can adjust, and never promise 100%, 5% chance of loss, 110% reserve, for 6 months. $733/mo. Just under $4,400 for 6 months. Part of me says that’s too much, which means we either adjust to less chance of loss, less reserve, or less coverage. 5% is pretty high, it assumes that 5% of our industry loses 100% of their money every 6 months in a hack.
