# How the Insurance Works

## Risk Assessment

**CL**<mark style="color:purple;">**AI**</mark>**M's AI analyzes on-chain data, user behavior, project performance, business model, and market trends to determine risk scores and premium rates.**

**Here's what happens:**

* Users undergo a brief personal assessment of how they use and hold tokens.
* Self-reporting of assets and locations of assets helps determine values.
* Wallet connection and monitoring is used to adjust values according to user behavior and the markets.
* Higher risk assets and users may experience higher premiums or may be denied coverage.

## Claims Process

**Here's how a claim is handled:**

* Claimant submits a claim with evidence through the portal.
* AI system performs initial fraud detection and claim assessment.
* DAO members review and vote on the claim.
* If approved, payout is processed automatically from the claims pool.

## Payout Structure

**Here's how you get your bags back:**

* Payouts are made primarily in USDT/USDC to ensure stable value.
* Payout percentage is determined by a curve based on premium paid and coverage amount.
* Maximum coverage is capped to prevent abuse.
