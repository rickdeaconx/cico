# How it Works

## Threat Detection and URL Analysis

**‍**\
ThreatSlayerAI will evaluate links from the ThreatSlayer security browser extension while enhancing the speed and effectiveness of our unique [Security Staking](https://x.com/interlockweb3/status/1871154527698604354) feature. It will operate autonomously, eliminating the need for users to evaluate links one-by-one. This will allow for rewards for URL reporting to be delivered quickly and accurately

## New Scam URL Aggregation

\
The AI agent will actively collect new scam URLs shared across social media platforms like X and Discord, expanding its threat database. Since ThreatSlayer currently only works on desktop browsers, this allows us to protect users from scams shared in these popular communication channels. The AI will also add new known good sites in Web3 more quickly, reducing false positives.

## Malicious Wallet and Smart Contract Addresses

\
ThreatSlayerAI will scan websites found by users of ThreatSlayer to identify wallets and smart contracts, assessing their potential malicious nature, adding an extra layer of security for users.\


## Patterns and Fuzzing

\
The system will identify patterns in website URLs and employ fuzzing techniques to discover other potentially malicious sites, proactively expanding its threat detection capabilities. This attack is commonly known as a “homograph attack”

## User Queries

\
While primarily operating in the background, ThreatSlayerAI will be able to be queried by users seeking specific data or insights into the threats we’ve discovered.

## Data We Process and Sell

\
ThreatSlayerAI will process submitted data, removing duplicates and false positives to maintain a clean, accurate database of threats. This structure will allow ThreatSlayerAI to function as a powerful, largely autonomous tool in the cybersecurity landscape, combining advanced AI capabilities with user-submitted data to create a robust and efficient threat detection and reporting ecosystem.
